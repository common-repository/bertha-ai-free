[*How Does Bertha AI Work?*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDk9HkXX_64)

But HOW??

*AI works similarly to the human mind:*

When we speak or write, we string ideas, concepts, and previous knowledge to single words, or fractions of words that compile sentences, paragraphs, and finally a story.

Often we don’t know what we will say when we start to speak, We may have an idea, but the exact words are generated on the fly.
